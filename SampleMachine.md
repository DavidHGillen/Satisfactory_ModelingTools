# Sample Machine
This is a simple, nodescript box with SF styled details and a belt in/out. It can be used with attirubtation for any mod, but I would recommend learning from it instead.

## Usage
I keep meshes in parts because that's easier to work with and then merge them at import time or export a merged version.

This file contains both a skeletal mesh and static mesh if you wish to experiment with that.

Static mesh is featured in [ficsit docs](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/2.2.0/Development/BeginnersGuide/SimpleMod/machines/SimpleMachine.html)
